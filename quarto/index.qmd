# Welcome to my website!
Hello everyone, I'm Lu Xianzhou, a passionate learner and practitioner.
I specialize in the field of technology, constantly exploring new knowledge and dedicated to applying what I've learned into practical use. 
 I value teamwork and believe that collective efforts can create greater value.
 I also love sports. Through sports, I can not only keep my body healthy but also feel vitality and passion in the process of sweating.
I am very glad to introduce myself here. I hope that in the future, I can become friends with you and spend wonderful times together.
